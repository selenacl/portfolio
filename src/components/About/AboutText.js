          <p>I'm a Florida native who has graduated with my B.S. in <b>Computer Science</b> this
          past December (2019). My <b>passion</b> for technology started as a kid playing
          videogames, grew as I taught myself basic html as a teen, then catapulted
          once I took my first programming class. I've taken a deeper interest in 
          creating <b>web apps</b> recently but am interested in <b>all aspects </b>
          of development.</p>

          <p>My <b>immediate goals</b> are to continue learning <b>React</b> and <b>Node</b> in my free time,  
          learn <b>Angular</b> and <b>Java Spring</b> professionally, and learn more about <b>UI/UX</b> design. My <b>medium-term goals </b>
          are to dive into data analysis, machine learning, and AI concepts to gain exposure
          to more areas of computer science, as well as <b>lead</b> a team and <b> mentor </b> 
          juniors developers. Unfortunately I can't see the future but I'd say for now my <b>long-term goals </b>
          are to be the <b>person you can turn to</b> when needing to know the most
          obscure of details on out current project!</p>

          <p>Aside from development I love videogames, the beach, exercising at the gym, 
            rock climbing, and all types of <b>baked goods</b>.
