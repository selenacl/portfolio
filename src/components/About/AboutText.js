          <p>I'm a Florida native, graduating with my B.S. in <b>Computer Science</b> this
          December (2019). My <b>passion</b> for technology started as a kid playing
          videogames, grew as I taught myself basic html as a teen, then catapulted
          once I took my first programming class. I've taken a deeper interest in 
          creating <b>web apps</b> recently but am interested in <b>all aspects </b>
          of development.</p>

          <p>My <b>immediate goals</b> are to begin a full time position as a <b>developer</b>,
          master <b>ReactJS</b>, and learn more about <b>UI/UX</b> design. My <b>medium-term goals </b>
          are to be an <b>expert</b> in the fundamentals of development, <b>lead</b> a team, 
          <b> mentor</b> juniors developers, and gain exposure to more areas of computer science.
          Unfortunately I can't see the future but I'd say for now my <b>long term goals </b>
          are to be the <b>person you can turn to</b> when needing to know the most
          obscure of details on out current project!</p>

          <p>Aside from development I love videogames, the beach, exercising at the gym, 
            rock climbing, and all types of <b>baked goods</b>.
          </p>
